The song that was supposed to be played on the background is called Ã–iset
Kitarat, performed by Suuri Tango-orkesteri Bandola. I think the song is
originally by Olavi Virta.
This game was built around the song, but I hold absolutely no rights to the song
and therefore the song is not included in this repository.
